# Model Driven Engineering (MDE) Coursework - 2023/2024

Welcome to the repository for my MDE coursework, a collection of projects showcasing the application of model-driven engineering principles across various domains. 🌐

## Highlights

- **A1 - UML Class Diagrams**: Dive into the foundational aspects of MDE with comprehensive UML class diagrams. 📊
- **A2 - Language Engineering with MPS**: Explore the creation of domain-specific languages using JetBrains MPS. 🛠️
- **A3 - EMF and OCL**: Get hands-on with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Object Constraint Language (OCL) for robust model validation. 🔍
- **A4 - Model Transformations**: Witness the power of model-to-model and model-to-code transformations. 🔄
- **A5 - Visual and Textual Editors**: Unleash creativity with Sirius for graphical modeling and Xtext for textual DSLs. ✍️

## Tools and Technologies

This project extensively uses **Eclipse Modeling Tools** for designing, validating, and transforming models. Eclipse provides a rich set of tools that support the development of model-driven applications, enhancing our ability to define, manipulate, and manage complex systems with precision and efficiency. Through Eclipse, we leverage frameworks such as **EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework)** for defining models and Ecore metamodels, and **OCL (Object Constraint Language)** for specifying constraints on models, ensuring robust design and validation of our systems.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to explore and run the projects:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone URL`
2. Navigate to each project folder.
3. Refer to specific setup instructions within each assignment's directory.

## Contributions

Your insights and improvements are welcome! 🌟 If you're interested in contributing, please:
