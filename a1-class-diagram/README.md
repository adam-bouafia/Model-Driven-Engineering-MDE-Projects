# A1-Class-Diagram
Define a metamodel in terms of a UML Class Diagram on the genMyModel platform (https://app.genmymodel.com) that captures the domain provided in A0.
You have to deliver the class diagram of the domain in A0 and an object diagram describing one instance of the metamodel.

Content:

1. genmymodel, metamodel in terms of a UML class diagram;
2. genmymodel, at least two model instances in terms of an object diagram.

In order to fulfil the submission requirements, students are expected to provide their produced artefacts in either of the following formats: i) a PDF file that includes class and object diagrams exported as pictures, or ii) a publicly accessible link to the genMyModel project, which should be appended to this readme file.
